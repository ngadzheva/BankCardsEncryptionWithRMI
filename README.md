# BankCardsEncryptionWithRMI
<p> The purpose of the project is to implement a customer-specific application for encryption of bank cards. System users have the ability to encrypt a bank card number and retrieve a card number on a cryptogram, for which purpose they must have the appropriate access rights and be logged into the system. The server part implements the validation and verification of the user data, performs the necessary calculations and outputs the results to the user. Additionally, it allows to store user information and their rights in an XML file, as well as to display a text file with a table of encrypted cards, sorted by a specific attribute. </p>
<br/>
<p> The algorithm used for the encryption is <b> <i> Route Cipher </i> </b> . </p>
<p> For validating the card number is used <b> <i> Luhn formula </i> </b> . </p>
